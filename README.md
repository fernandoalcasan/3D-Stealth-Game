A 3D stealth/cinematic game made with Unity to be played in a PC.

Are your skills enough to sneak into the main vault of the Beatrice Auction House? Put yourself into Darren's shoes and try to steal millions without being noticed.

I developed the game using assets from the [Unity asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/the-great-fleece-110186).

This game applies concepts like:

- Virtual cameras (Cinemachine)
- Cinematic events handled with a timeline
- Working with previs elements to build cutscenes
- NavMesh agents to implement movement of AI and player
- Storytelling
